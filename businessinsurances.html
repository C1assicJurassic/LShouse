        <h1> The Burden Small Bussines Holds</h1>
        <p>Every small owner dreams of employing a wonderful  team to expand there business. The problem that
            owners have is suppling the health insruance to those employees. The burden is given to the employor and the weight handed to the emplyee.
            If owners didn't have to give health coverage to their workers the wages given can be in the "liveble" range and even competitive.
