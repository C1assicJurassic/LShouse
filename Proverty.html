        <h1> Proverty Shouldn't Be The Only Way</h1>
        <p>There are sentors in states that want to reduce the amount of income it takes to recivce any social benifits. 
            There is also talk about limiting the foods that those benifts holders can buy. Their claim is that WIC holdersare limited to bread, beans, rice, canned furit, and some times cheese.
            They want to pull fresh pridce and meats away from thise who need it the most. No one should be on the verge of homelessness and 
            starvation with no income just to recive some help. Many men that are single are expemt from many 
            of these programs. If we stop throwing moiney at a hemerging problem and come to a soltioun that
            saves money and lives should be dicussed.
